# Charleene

iOS - UIModalPresentationFormSheet for iPhone

![](https://github.com/KitchenStories/Charleene/blob/master/images/charleene-header.png)

Charleene is simple, modern and lightweight solution for porting the UIModalPresentationFormSheet (known as a system API feature on iPads) to iPhones.

Charleene takes any UIViewController as containing UIViewController and presents it modally. 

Whenever Charleene is used on the iPad it calls the iOS system API for UIModalPresentationFormSheet.
