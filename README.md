Charleene is simple, modern and lightweight solution for porting the UIModalPresentationFormSheet (known as a system API feature on iPads) to iPhones.

Charleene takes any UIViewController as containing UIViewController and presents it modally.

For an example on how to communicate back from the containing UIViewController to the presenting UIViewController see the demo project included in this repository (hint: There’s no other magic used than good old delegation pattern).

## Usage

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

### Include

Include the corresponding category on UIViewController in your implementation file

```objc
#import <UIViewController+Charleene.h>
```

### Presentation

Usage is as simple as that:

From Storyboard:

````objc
ViewControllerOfYourChoice *vc = [[UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@“Main” bundle:nil] instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@“ViewControllerOfYourChoice”];
[self presentCharleeneModally:vc transitionMode:KSModalTransitionModeFromBottom];
```

From Code:

````objc  
ViewControllerOfYourChoice *vc = [[ViewControllerOfYourChoice alloc] init];    
[self presentCharleeneModally:vc transitionMode:KSModalTransitionModeFromBottom];

````

### Dismissal

Dismissal is as simple as calling the following method on any UIViewController

````objc
[self dismissCharleeneAnimated:YES completion:nil];
````
